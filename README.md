# Wij Bieren App
This is a project that I had to do in Single Page Application class. It is an application made with Angular, Typescript, HTML and CSS. Users are able to discover beers, modify them, add them or delete them. They can also discover beers by cities and stores. All changes made by a user are persisted through an API that makes connections to a MongoDB database and a Neo4j database.

I had 1 week and a half to make the Angular application and the API + NoSQL databases.
